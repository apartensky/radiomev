        <h4>WebMeV Dataset Archive</h4>
        <p>You can download the entire MeV dataset as a ZIP archive by clicking the <span class="text-success"><i class="fa fa-file-archive-o text-success"></i> icon</span> next to the dataset name. This archive will contain the original data as well as any analyses and annotations.</p>
        <p>The MeV archive can be uploaded back into MeV for viewing or continued analysis. To do so use the Upload button.</p>

        <h4>Note on Data Storage</h4>
        <p>MeV does not store your data on the server beyond the duration of your session. Once your session times out - all your data is deleted from the server.</p>
        <p>Your dataset and analyses are saved to the browser's local storage on your computer. You will find them under "Offline Datatasets" section below "Your Datasets"</p>
        <p>You may activate an offline dataset for viewing or further analysis by clicking the <span class="text-success"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-cloud-upload"></i> icon</span> next to the offline dataset</p>
        <p>Please note, the amount of disk space available to save offline datasets is determined by your browser. If this disk quota is exceeded the browser will delete the offline datasets.</p>
        <p>To ensure your MeV dataset is saved indefinitely you may download it to your machine as a zip archive.</p>
